# 🧸 The Bear — A Calm Interactive Web Experience

**The Bear** is a minimalist, story-driven web experience that blends **design, animation, and narrative** to reflect the quiet strength and patience of nature.  
It’s not just a website — it’s a space where calm meets creativity.

## 🌿 Concept

Inspired by the nature of bears — patient, strong, and introspective — this project was created to showcase how **motion and stillness** can coexist in design.  
Every interaction, animation, and transition was crafted with intention — to feel **alive yet peaceful**.

> “Good design doesn’t shout — it breathes.”
